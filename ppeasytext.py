covid_desc = 'COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness. \n\nSymptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:\n\n•Fever or chills\n•Cough\n•Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n•Fatigue\n•Muscle or body aches\n•Headache\n•New loss of taste or smell\n•Sore throat\n•Congestion or runny nose\n•Nausea or vomiting\n•Diarrhea \n\nEmergency warning signs. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately:\n\n•Trouble breathing\n•Persistent pain or pressure in the chest\n•New confusion\n•Inability to wake or stay awake\n•Bluish lips or face \n\nCOVID-19 most commonly spreads during close contact. People who are physically near (within 6 feet) a person with COVID-19 or have direct contact with that person are at greatest risk of infection. \n\nWhen people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe they produce respiratory droplets. These droplets can range in size from larger droplets (some of which are visible) to smaller droplets. Small droplets can also form particles when they dry very quickly in the airstream. \n\nInfections occur mainly through exposure to respiratory droplets when a person is in close contact with someone who has COVID-19. Respiratory droplets cause infection when they are inhaled or deposited on mucous membranes, such as those that line the inside of the nose and mouth. \n\nAs the respiratory droplets travel further from the person with COVID-19, the concentration of these droplets decreases. Larger droplets fall out of the air due to gravity. Smaller droplets and particles spread apart in the air.With passing time, the amount of infectious virus in respiratory droplets also decreases.'
